# Django-Reddit

A reddit clone built with Django/React

https://jf-reddit-clone.herokuapp.com/

Features:
Modified Preorder Tree Traversal(MPTT) for reddit like comment tree structures.
Voting and Karma scoring systems
JWT Authentication using a longer living HTTP-Only refresh token cookie, and a short lived access token sent within the request/response bodies.
Sanitized text fields in both the back and front end to prevent XSS.
Client side validation
Awful looking but functional UI.
